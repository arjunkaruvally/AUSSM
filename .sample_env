## these are necessary for the script to find the required files
# this is where the data is stored. in case of huggingface, the data may need to be first downloaded to the location prior to use
export DATA_ROOT=/data
# this the location where the experiment outputs are writte to

# this is the root of the code
export CODE_ROOT=/AUSSM
# this is the conda environment path
